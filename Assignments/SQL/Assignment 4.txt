1. Write a T-SQL Program to find the factorial of a given number.

Answer:

DECLARE @N Bigint = 3
DECLARE @F Bigint = 1
WHILE @N > 0 BEGIN
  SET @F = @f*@n
  SET @N = @N-1
END
SELECT @F AS FACTORIAL

2. Create a stored procedure to generate multiplication tables up to a given number.

Answer:

create procedure tables
@F Bigint,--multipiler
@M bigint,--initial value
@N Bigint--final value
as
declare @K bigint; --output
WHILE @M <= @N
begin
  Set @K = @f*@M
  PRINT CONCAT(@F,'*', @M,'=',@K)
  SET @M = @M+1
end
go

exec tables 2,1,10

      
3. Create a trigger to restrict data manipulation on EMP table during General holidays. 
Display the error message like “Due to Independence day you cannot manipulate data” or "Due To Diwali", you cannot manupulate" etc
Note: Create holiday table as (holiday_date,Holiday_name) store at least 4 holiday details. try to match and stop manipulation.

Answer:

create trigger DML_No on Holiday
INSTEAD OF INSERT,update,delete
AS
BEGIN
 PRINT 'Due to Independence day you cannot manipulate data'
END
